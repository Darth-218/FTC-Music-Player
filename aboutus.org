* Zein Hatem
** Data Manager
You're probably wondering what kind of glorious leader could've organised such a
legendary project. Well, you need wonder no more! With about 50 programming
languages under his built--and many more to come!--This fellow will surely leave
a good impression.
* Ahmed Afifi
** Web-Based Backend Developer
Meet the man that got this team together! Without him, we probably would never
have met each other, and without his powerful C# API, you would never have met
your favourite songs in our app! (unless, of course, you had them downloaded
locally).
* TODO Ahmed Abdel-maboud
** UX Designer
* Yahia Gaber
** OS-Based Backend Developer
This man has to go through a perilous adventure every single day, crossing
oceans and fighting *at least* three dragons (not to mention the hordes of their
minions) just to get to his morning lectures from his abode all the way in El
Moqattam.
