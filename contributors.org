* TEAM LEADER: Zein Hatem
We work with a ton of data. From the SearchRequests that get sent to YouTube and
the SearchResults that get sent back,  the Songs, Albums, Artists, and Playlists
that we get from  those SearchResults or from the local files in  the OS, not to
mention  the  player  that actually  plays  the  music,  all  of that  is  data;
therefore, all of that has to pass through Zein.
** Classes:
*** Data:
**** Application
***** Song
A single song, whether from YouTube or the user's file system.
***** Artist
An artist that has made some songs.
***** Album
An album containing songs an artist has made.
***** Playlist
A playist the user has created.
***** User
A user of our application.
**** Web API
***** SearchRequest
A request that will be sent to our API to be eventually sent to YT.
***** SearchResult
The response the API has given, translated from the JSON sent from YT.
*** API
**** Player
The thing that actually plays the music.
**** PlayerState
Enumerates the possible states that the player can be in.
**** VlcMediaPlayer
Implementation of Player. Uses python-vlc to play the music.
**** PlayerWidget
Manages the Player class and provides an interface to the user so they can
interact with it (the bit at the bottom of the screen with the buttons and the
slider).
* TODO Ahmed Afifi
There aren't any good Python libraries for communicating with YouTube over
HTTPS, so Afifi made an API in C# that lets us do just that, as well as the
Python API client that lets us use it. He also worked on most of the GUI.
* TODO Ahmed Abdel-maboud
Originally was the one responsible for, and who wrote most of, the GUI as we
went from graphics lib to another. We switched from TKInter to customTKInter to
kivy to curses before finally settling on something that worked. That something
was flet, and Adbel-maboud worked on most of the scratched GUI code.
* TODO Yahia Gaber
The swiss army knife of our group, he worked on the system for getting songs
from the files local to the user's machine, as well as helping with some of the
UI among other things.
